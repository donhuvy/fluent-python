# Notes

## Treating a Function Like an Object

* Functions in Python are "first-class" objects:
    * Created at runtime
    * Assigned to a variable or element in a data structure
    * Passed as an argument to a function (e.g., map a function)
    * Returned as a result of a function

## Higher-Order Functions

* Functions that take in a function as argument or return a function as a result are higher-order functions:
  * Example: `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, they return generators, not as important since introduction of list comprehensions and generator expressions
